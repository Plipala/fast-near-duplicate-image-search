# Fast Near-Duplicate Image Search and Delete
* Author: Umberto Griffo
* Twitter: @UmbertoGriffo

This Python script is a command line tool for checking and deleting near-duplicate images based on perceptual hash from the target directory.
In order to find similar images this script hashes the images using **pHash** from [ImageHash](https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/) library,
adding the hash into a **KDTree** and perform a **nearest neighbours** search.

## pHash definition

Features in the image are used to generate a distinct (but not unique) fingerprint, and these fingerprints are comparable.
[Perceptual hashes](http://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php%3F/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) are a different concept compared to cryptographic hash functions like **MD5** and **SHA1**.

![phash](https://github.com/umbertogriffo/fast-near-duplicate-image-search/blob/master/images/phash.png)

With cryptographic hashes, the hash values are random. The data used to generate the hash acts like a random seed, 
so the same data will generate the same result, but different data will create different results.
Comparing two **SHA1** hash values really only tells you two things. 
If the hashes are different, then the data is different. 
And if the hashes are the same, then the data is likely the same. 
(Since there is a possibility of a hash collision, having the same hash values does not guarantee the same data.) 
In contrast, perceptual hashes can be compared giving you a sense of similarity between the two data sets.
Using **pHash** images can be scaled larger or smaller, have different aspect ratios, and even minor coloring differences 
(contrast, brightness, etc.) and they will still match similar images.

## KDTree definition
A [KDTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree)(short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing 
points in a k-dimensional space. 
In particular, **KDTree** helps organize and partition the data points based on specific conditions.
KDTree is a useful for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches).

### Complexity (Average)

|Scape|Search|Insert|Delete|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|O(n)|O(log n)|O(log n)|O(log n)|

where **n** is the number of points.

SW Environment
==============
#### TL;DR 
Install Anaconda and then create the environment:
```
conda env create -f fast_near_duplicate_img_src_py3.yml
```

#### Let’s create an Anaconda environments
```
conda create -n fast_near_duplicate_img_src_py3 python=3.6
```

 To activate this environment, use:
 > source activate fast_near_duplicate_img_src_py3

 To deactivate an active environment, use:
 > source deactivate

##### Install the basic libraries
```
source activate fast_near_duplicate_img_src_py3
conda install pip pandas scikit-learn scipy numpy matplotlib seaborn pillow natsort==5.5.0 tqdm
```
##### ImageHash 4.0 - Image Hashing library
```
pip install ImageHash
```
##### OpenCV 4.0.0.21 (Not Mandatory)
```
apt install libgtk2.0-dev python3-tk
pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.0.0.21
```
##### Pytest 4.1.1 in order to develop Unit/Mock test
```
pip install -U pytest
```

Usage
=====
#### Delete near-duplicate images from the target directory

```
$ app.py delete --images_path target_dir --output_path output_dir --tree_type KDTree
```
```

```
#### Show near-duplicate images from the target directory With t-SNE 
```
$ app.py show --images_path target_dir --output_path output_dir
```
