# Fast Near-Duplicate Image Search and Delete
* Author: Umberto Griffo
* Twitter: @UmbertoGriffo

This Python script is a command line tool for visualizing, checking and deleting near-duplicate images from the target directory.
In order to find similar images this script hashes the images using **pHash** from 
[ImageHash](https://pypi.org/project/ImageHash/) library,
adding the hash into a **KDTree** and perform a **nearest neighbours** search.
In addition, near-duplicate images can be visualized generating a 
[t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/) 
using a feature vector for each image derived from the **pHash** function.
> I take no responsibility for bugs in this script or accidentally deleted pictures. 
> Use at your own risk. Make sure you back up your pictures before using.
> This algorithm is intended to find nearly duplicate images. It is NOT intended to find images that are conceptually 
similar.

## pHash definition

Features in the image are used to generate a distinct (but not unique) fingerprint, and these fingerprints are comparable.
[Perceptual hashes](http://hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php%3F/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) are a different concept 
compared to cryptographic hash functions like **MD5** and **SHA1**.

![phash](https://github.com/umbertogriffo/fast-near-duplicate-image-search/blob/master/docs/images/phash.png)

With cryptographic hashes, the hash values are random. The data used to generate the hash acts like a random seed, 
so the same data will generate the same result, but different data will create different results.
Comparing two **SHA1** hash values really only tells you two things. 
If the hashes are different, then the data is different. 
And if the hashes are the same, then the data is likely the same. 
(Since there is a possibility of a hash collision, having the same hash values does not guarantee the same data.) 
In contrast, perceptual hashes can be compared giving you a sense of similarity between the two data sets.
Using **pHash** images can be scaled larger or smaller, have different aspect ratios, and even minor coloring differences 
(contrast, brightness, etc.) and they will still match similar images.

## KDTree definition
A [KDTree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree)(short for k-dimensional tree) is a space-partitioning data structure for organizing 
points in a k-dimensional space. 
In particular, **KDTree** helps organize and partition the data points based on specific conditions.
KDTree is a useful for several applications, such as searches involving a multidimensional search key (e.g. range searches and nearest neighbor searches).

### Complexity (Average)

|Scape|Search|Insert|Delete|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|O(n)|O(log n)|O(log n)|O(log n)|

where **n** is the number of points.

Installation
============
Check [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.

How to use the Makefile
=======================
#### Prerequisites

Install `Python3` and `virtualenv` see `Option 2` in [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)

* All-in-one: ```make all```
  * Setup, test and package.
* Setup: ```make setup-env```
  * Installs all dependencies.
* Export dependencies of the environment: ```make export_env```
  * Export a requirements.txt file containing the detailed dependencies of the environment.
* Test: ```make test```
  * Runs all tests.
  * Using [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
* Clean: ```make clean```
  * Removes the environment.
  * Removes all cached files.
* Check: ```make check```
  * Use It to check that `which pip3` and `which python3` points to the right path.
* Lint: ```make lint```
  * Checks PEP8 conformance and code smells using [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/).
* Package: ```make package```
  * Creates a bundle of software to be installed.

**Note:** Run `Setup` as your init command (or after `Clean`)
